        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The aim of this project is to create an automated robot that will monitor house plants and provide regular updates 
            on their water level, position, and type. The robot will utilize machine learning to predict plant type, so it can 
            determine how much water is considered healthy. It will measure moisture levels using an arm attached with a soil 
            moisture sensor to keep track of them. Additionally, it keeps track of the position to know where the plant is. This 
            project aims to encourage plant ownership and promote a healthier lifestyle by simplifying plant care for plants that 
            are regionally local. The robot is expected to be beneficial to users and the environment, fostering a thriving ecosystem 
            of indoor plants.
